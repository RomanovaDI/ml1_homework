a more exotic car.  front runners\\nincluded the toyota supra turbo and the porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\ni narrowed it down to those two.  i liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a porsche.  the supra turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\ni was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  i asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"if you buy the supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe celica (the \\'85 celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"if you buy the porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  and if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"but the supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  that doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n that\\'s what the book says.  we don\\'t insure corvettes, either.  for\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\ni eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons.  the porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  at equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the porsche, plus its higher insurance.  i\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   everyone\\'s entitled to my opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========imagination is more important than knowledge. -

saturnian\\n    system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe. cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv/centaur in october of 1997.\\n    after gravity assists of venus, earth and jupiter in a vvejga\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004. upon\\n    arrival, the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around saturn. near the end of this initial orbit, the huygens\\n    probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    titan. the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. after the completion of the probe mission, the orbiter\\n    continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years. titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and\\n    targeted flybys of iapetus, dione and enceladus. the objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. these\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the paris observatory, who discovered several of\\n    saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. the titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan\\n    huygens (1629-1695), who discovered titan

bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. it will pass over the sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. its aphelion is 5.2 au, and, surprisingly, its\\n

\\nwhile the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration \\ncamps, the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian \\nbattalion to fight alongside the nazis. in 1943, this battalion had \\ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\\nformer guerilla leader dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\\nshort-lived armenian dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \\ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds between 1914-1920.\\nan armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party \\nleaders in berlin, which was recognized by the nazis. encouraged by \\nthis, the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the jews.\\n\\nthis armenian-nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the armenians during wwi, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million turks by colluding with the invading russian army.\\n\\nfurthermore, as mccarthy put it, the armenian dictatorship was granted\\na respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros\\narmistice with the allies (october 30, 1918). the allies had decided\\nto create a greater armenia, including the old russian province\\nof yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of anatolia\\nclaimed by the armenian fanatics. only the area called cilicia\\n(around the ottoman province of adana) was to be excluded, as it\\nhad already been claimed by the french. the allies quickly set\\nabout attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks, who\\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \\n\\non april 19, 1919 the british army occupied kars, gave civilian\\nand military power over to the armenians, then withdrew. the british\\nplanned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship, even \\nthough the russian pre-war census had shown kars province to be over\\n60% muslim. the turks of kars were effectively disarmed, but the \\nbritish could not disarm the kurds of the mountains. the fate of\\nthe turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\\nin eastern anatolia. murder, pillage,

(you can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the ssme exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [external tank side] of the stack.) the\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the saturn v\\'s.  (a side note: the\\n    saturn v\\'s also had a roll program.  don\\'t ask me why -- i\\'m a shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics.\\the added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  the yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  the total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    how to receive the nasa tv channel, nasa select\\n\\n    nasa select is broadcast by satellite. if you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find select on satcom f2r, transponder 13, c-band, 72\\n    degrees west longitude, audio 6.8, frequency 3960 mhz. f2r is stationed\\n    over the atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    california and points west. during events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), select is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    if you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry select.\\n    it\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    the select schedule is found in the nasa headline news which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by nasa officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. select has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with spacelink) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    amateur radio frequencies for shuttle missions\\n\\n    the following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tw6fxn  - los angeles\\n\\tk6mf   - ames research center, mountain view, california\\n\\twa3nan - goddard space flight center (gsfc), greenbelt, maryland.\\n\\tw5rrr  - johnson space center (jsc), houston, texas\\n\\tw6vio  - jet propulsion laboratory (jpl), pasadena, california.\\n\\tw1aw voice bulletins\\n\\n\\tstation    vhf\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tw6fxn\\t 145.46\\n\\tk6mf\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\twa3nan\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tw5rrr\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tw6vio\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tw6vio\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tw1aw\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    w5rrr transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying keplerian elements and mission information.\\n\\n    w1aw also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. no mission audio but they\\n    transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 utc.\\n\\n    frequencies in the 10-20m bands require usb and frequencies in the 40\\n    and 80m bands lsb. use fm for the vhf frequencies.\\n\\n    [this item was most recently updated courtesy of gary morris\\n    (g@telesoft.com, kk6yb, n5qwc)]\\n\\n\\n    solid rocket booster fuel composition\\n\\n    reference: \"shuttle flight operations manual\" volume 8b - solid rocket\\n    booster systems, nasa document jsc-12770\\n\\n    propellant composition (percent)\\n\\n    ammonium perchlorate (oxidizer)\\t\\t\\t69.6\\n    aluminum\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t16\\n    iron oxide (burn rate catalyst)\\t\\t\\t0.4\\n    polybutadiene-acrilic acid-acrylonitrile (a rubber) 12.04\\n    epoxy curing agent\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1.96\\n\\n    end reference\\n\\n    comment: the aluminum, rubber, and epoxy all burn with the oxidizer.',\n",

(though christians may well hold beliefs\\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \\ntopics.)\\n \\n\\nnote that these are two separate ideas. most hold the first view, but the \\nmajority do not hold the second. is is again a matter of pure logic that\\nif christanity is true, then hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, christaianity. \\n(and, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\\n \\n\\nit is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \\nthey have told you. christians believe god has told us what he thinks\\nand wants.\\n\\n\\nmost christians do not base their belief on the bible, but on the living\\ntradition of the church established by christ and guided constantly\\nby the holy spirit. the bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\\n\\n\\nif depends what you mean by differing. if i believe tom is six feet\\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \\nmay both be right. if i believe tom is six feet tall and you beleive\\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\\n \\n\\nthus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \\ncan find it. you assert that anyone who believe that we can find \\nabsolute truth is mistaken. in short, you believe that anyone who\\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. qed.\\n\\n\\nhere i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. saying that the glass \\nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (the whole\\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\\n \\nit is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \\nsame belief in different words. it is also true that they may fail\\nto understand each other\\'s words as expressions of the same belief\\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. great\\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\\nagreement in belief. this does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\\nare equally valid. since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\\nto say so. if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct, \\nbut if y is equivalent to not-x then one of us is wrong and as long\\nas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other \\nas in error.',\n",

       " 'hello src readers,\\n\\nagain the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox\\nchurches believe in monophysitism pops up again. we had a discussion\\nabout it a while ago. \\n\\n\\nthen ofm comments :\\n\\n\\nwith my appreciation to the moderator, i believe that further elaboration\\nis needed. this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the copt-net newsletter :\\n\\nunder the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of rome), the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played\\nleading roles in  christian theology.  they were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the christian faith. st. cyril, pope of alexandria, was the head of the\\necumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year 430 a.d. it was said\\nthat the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. this leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  church affairs.  it all started when the emperor\\nmarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church. the response of st.\\ndioscorus, the pope of alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"you have nothing to do with the church.\"  these political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in chalcedon  in 451, when the coptic  church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. this  doctrine maintains that the  lord jesus christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nthe coptic  church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the council of chalcedon!  in  that council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  copts   believe that the lord   is perfect in  his\\ndivinity,  and he   is perfect in  his humanity,  but  his  divinity  and his\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by st. cyril of alexandria.  copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the coptic divine liturgy).  these  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nthe  coptic church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  council  of\\nchalcedon.  perhaps the council  understood   the church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  egyptian,\\nindependent pope. despite  all of this,  the coptic church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nwestern churches to exile the coptic church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether pope dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  copts  are not  monophysite, the coptic\\nchurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  christian  churches.   this is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  st. mark, pope shenouda iii:  \"to the  coptic church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  throughout this  century,  the\\ncoptic church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. the\\ncoptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches. it has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 a.d.   the coptic church is  a\\nmember  of the all  african council of churches  (aacc)  and the  middle east\\ncouncil of  churches (mecc).  the church    plays an  important role   in the\\nchristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  catholic, greek orthodox, presbyterian, and\\nevangelical churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nas a final note, the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign\\na common statement of christology, in which the heresey of monophysitism\\nwas condemned. so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in\\nmonophysitism.\\n\\npeace,\\n\\nnabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  nabil ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  engine research center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  dept. of mechanical engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  university of wisconsin-madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[as i mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite.  as\\nandrew byler correctly stated it, the nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  the point i was making, which nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nchalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the alexandrians and\\nantiochenes.  it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  i agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  however in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  and some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  there are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  this\\nposting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians.  there are also\\na remaining nestorians.  like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nnestorians are not heretical either.  they sheltered nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe antiochene tradition.',\n",

(at least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nin other words, near as i can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  i\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nnote that that doesn\\'t mean i think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  just as i\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  so in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nwhile i\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"lacey and his friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by david drake.  the us starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  but don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but leas with warrants can\\nget to it.  and by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nand then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  then in some private places.  then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  only alone.  and with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  but, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  we haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  and just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nvr helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nand hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nafter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nfunny, though.  while speeding and the radar detector industry became\\npretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn\\'t elminate all\\ncrime in the story.  and somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds\\nof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their\\nexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of\\ncompetition.  and not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  \\ni can\\'t imagine why.\\n',\n",

       " 'michael bushnell writes;\\n\\n\\nwhich is exactly what i pointed out.  (though i was wrong about your use\\nof the creed, the 1913 catholic encylcopedia in which i read about it\\nsaid the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque.  apparently that\\nhas changed.)  the athanasian creed has always had the filioque, the\\nnicene - constantinopolitan did not.\\n\\tof course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicene\\ncreed (it wasn\\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\\nathanasian creed, which did have it from the beginning.\\n\\ti might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\\nways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity, the east\\nemphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the father\\nthrough the son, and the west using proceeding from the father and the\\nson.  in fact, some, such as tertullian, used both formulations (see\\nbelow)\\n\\n\\t\"following, therefore, the form of these examples, i profess that i do\\ncall god and his word, - the father and and his son, - two.  for the\\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\\nbut coherent ones.  anything which proceeds from another must\\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\\nthat account separated from it.  where there is second, however, there\\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  the spirit, then, is\\nthird from god and the son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-tertullian, against praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 ad)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father\\nthrough the son\"\\n\\t-tertullian, against praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 ad)\\n\\nand as st. thomas showed in his summa theologica part 1, question 36,\\narticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\\nemphasize what st. augustine, among others taught, that the holy spirit\\nproceeds from the father and the son, but he proceeds from the father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"for whatever the son has, he has from the father, certainly he has it\\nfrom the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him ... for the\\nfather alone is not from another, for which reason he alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  the son, however, is born of the father; and the holy\\nspirit proceeds principally from the father, and since the father gives\\nto the son all that he has without any interval of time, the holy spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both father and son.  he would be called son of\\nthe father and of the son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten him.  the spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-st. augustine of hippo, the trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 ad)\\n\\nso, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the west at\\nleast), because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son, but\\nin proceeding from the son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the father, so the holy spirit is proceeding from the\\nfather through the son, but as all that the son has is from the father,\\nthe holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father, without any\\nmention of the son being necessary.\\n\\tin any case, i am happy to know that i follow in the beliefs of pope\\nst. leo i, st. fulgence of ruspe, st. cyril of alexandria, pope st.\\ndamsus i, st. augustine of hippo, st. epiphanius of salamis, st. ambrose\\nof milan, st. hilary of poitiers, tertullian, and others among the\\nfathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholic\\nposition, which i enunciated above.\\n\\tas for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden, i\\nwill point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spoke\\nof the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe fathers of nicea.\"  that creed is a different creed than that of\\nconstantinople, which is commonly called the nicene creed.  not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nconstantinopolitan creed, which is but an enlargement upon the creed of\\nnicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different creed from the one used by the\\nchurch, which among other things denied the procession of the holy\\nspirit form the son.  thus, the additions of the constantinopolitan\\ncreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the council\\nchalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holy\\nspirit from the son, which nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  and if the further explanations\\nof the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the arians\\nin spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the church until\\nmany years later under photius and others.  and that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, i provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\ngod, and he actually proceeds from the father and son, it is abundantly\\nclear that he is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-st. cyril of alexandria, the treasury of the holy and consubstantial\\ntrinity, thesis 34, (423-425 ad)\\n\\n\\t\"the holy spirit is not of the father only, or of the son only, but he\\nis the spirit of the father and the son.  for it is written: `if anyone\\nloves the world, the spirit of the father is not in him\\'; and again it\\nis written: `if anyone, however, does not have the spirit of christ, he\\nis none of his.\\'  when the father and the son are named in this way, the\\nholy spirit is understood, of whom the son himself says in the gospel,\\nthat the holy spirit `proceeds from the father,\\' and that `he shall\\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\\'\"\\n\\t-pope st. damasus i, the decree of damasus, 1 (382 ad)\\n\\n\\t\"the only-begotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor the\\nappelation of father, but is called holy spirit, and is not foreign to\\nthe father.  for the only-begotten himself calls him: `the spirit of the\\nfather,\\' and says of him the `he proceeds from the father,\\' and `will\\nreceive of mine,\\' so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to the\\nson, but is of their same substance, of the same godhead; he is spirit\\ndivine, ... of god, and he is god.  for he is spirit of god, spirit of\\nthe father, and spirit of the son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of father and son of the father\\nand of the son, a third by appelation....\\n\\t\"the father always existed and the son always existed, and the spirit\\nbreathes from the father and the son;

(to make things more interesting, luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes i\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  this isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nmatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  the fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nparticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  they say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  when talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nthis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nthis is not necessarily eternal torment.  this one can clearly be\\nunderstood either way, but i think it\\'s at least possible to think\\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\\neternity.\\n\\n2 thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\\nrevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\\nrevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  even there,\\nit doesn\\'t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  it says\\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \\nthere is no respite from it.  but it doesn\\'t say that the people\\nare tormented forever.\\n\\npsalm 9:17:  i don\\'t see that it says anything relevant to this issue.',\n",

 he won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since march 29.\\n\\nyet, when the series resumes wednesday, knickle will serve as hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic\\nsaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"if i\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...i\\ndropped too. 3.  what happened to no. 2?\"  stauber wondered.  \"not that i\\'d be\\nhappy with no. 2, but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nperhaps stauber eventually will get his chance, but melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nwhile insisting he is the kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" melrose said stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  they were,\\naccording to melrose: a 7-2 loss to san jose on dec. 26; an 8-3 loss to the new\\nyork rangers on jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with detroit on feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nvancouver on thursday.\\n\\n\"four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from kelly hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" melrose said.  \"an\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  the mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"i\\'m not blaming robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be no. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  you\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  robb stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe i expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nouch.  that remark stung stauber.  he began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after knickle was signed\\noff the san diego gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"i expect more from myself than anybody, including barry melrose,\" said stauber,\\na three-year star at the university of minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"what i\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can i go through?

       " 'archive-name: atheism/logic\\nalt-atheism-archive-name: logic\\nlast-modified: 5 april 1993\\nversion: 1.4\\n\\n                       constructing a logical argument\\n\\nalthough there is much argument on usenet, the general quality of argument\\nfound is poor.  this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nlogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [concise\\noed].  logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nnote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  the matter is very much open for debate.  this document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\npropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. a\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"it is\\nraining\" or \"today is tuesday\".  propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nthe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  so \"god exists\" and \"there exists a\\ngod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nan argument is, to quote the monty python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  an argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nfirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  these are called the premises of the argument.  they\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\npremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (the phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  if something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  you can always say \"oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nnext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  in inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  there are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nthe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nfinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nfor example:\\n\\nevery event has a cause (premise)\\nthe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nall beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nthis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\ntherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nnote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nsometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  this is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nrecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  for example:\\n\\n\"if the bible is accurate, jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the son of god.\"\\n\\nthis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  it does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nanother example:\\n\\n\"god created you; therefore do your duty to god.\"\\n\\nthe phrase \"do your duty to god\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nfinally, causality is important.  consider a statement of the form \"a because\\nb\".  if we\\'re interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  if we\\'re trying to establish the truth of b, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nfor example:\\n\\n\"there must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- this is an argument.\\n\\n\"my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- this is an explanation.\\n\\nthere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  a\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  a deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  a valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nan inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nthere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  however, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nit is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  this is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nobviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  however, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nfor example:\\n\\n   all insects have wings (premise)\\n   woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nhere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nif the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nthe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nmore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   all fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nhowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  we can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nthe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"a\" is the premise, \"b\" the conclusion. \\n\"t\" and \"f\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\npremise conclusion inference\\n   a        b        a=>b\\n----------------------------\\n   f        f         t      if the premises are false and the inference\\n   f        t         t      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   t        f         f      if the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   t        t         t      if the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\na sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  a sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nto delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  it is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  these pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nin everyday english the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  this is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nso for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  the following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nargumentum ad baculum (appeal to force)\\n\\nthe appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  it\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nthe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nfor example:\\n\"... thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible.  all those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in hell.\"\\n\\nargumentum ad hominem\\n\\nargumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nthe abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  this is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nfor example:\\n\"atheism is an evil philosophy.  it is practised by communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nsometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  this is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nargumentum ad ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nthe circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nfor example:\\n\"it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  how can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nthis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nthis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  for \\nexample:\\n\\n\"of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nyou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nthis particular form of argumentum ad hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nargumentum ad ignorantium\\n\\nargumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  this fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nexamples:\\n\"of course the bible is true.  nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nnote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nalso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  for example:\\n\\n\"a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  the earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nin science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nargumentum ad misericordiam\\n\\nthis is the appeal to pity, also known as special pleading.  the fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  for example:\\n\\n\"i did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; i\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nargumentum ad populum\\n\\nthis is known as appealing to the gallery, or appealing to the people.  to\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  this form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  for example:\\n\\n\"pornography must be banned.  it is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"the bible must be true.  millions of people know that it is.  are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nargumentum ad numeram\\n\\nthis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  it consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nargumentum ad verecundiam\\n\\nthe appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  for example:\\n\\n\"isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god.\"\\n\\nthis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  for example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nhawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nthe fallacy of accident\\n\\nthe fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  it is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  for example:\\n\\n\"christians generally dislike atheists.  you are a christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nthis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nconverse accident / hasty generalization\\n\\nthis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  it occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nfor example:\\n\"jim bakker was an insincere christian.  therefore all christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nsweeping generalization / dicto simpliciter\\n\\na sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nnon causa pro causa / post hoc ergo propter hoc\\n\\nthese are known as false cause fallacies.\\n\\nthe fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  for \\nexample:\\n\\n\"i took an aspirin and prayed to god, and my headache disappeared.  so god\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nthe fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  for \\nexample:\\n\\n\"the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism.  therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\ncum hoc ergo propter hoc\\n\\nthis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  it asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\npetitio principii\\n\\nthis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\ncirculus in demonstrando\\n\\nthis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  for example:\\n\\n\"homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\ntherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nnote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the british secret services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nanother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"we know that god exists because the bible tells us so.  and we know that the\\nbible is true because it is the word of god.\"\\n\\ncomplex question / fallacy of interrogation\\n\\nthis is the fallacy of presupposition.  one example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nthe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  this trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nsimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nignoratio elenchi\\n\\nthe fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nfor example, a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of christianity are undoubtably true.  if he then argues at length\\nthat christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true.\\n\\nsadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nequivocation\\n\\nequivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  for example:\\n\\n\"what could be more affordable than free software?  but to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\namphiboly\\n\\namphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\naccent\\n\\naccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  in this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  for example, consider:\\n\\n\"we should not speak ill of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"we should not speak ill of our friends\"\\n\\nfallacies of composition\\n\\none fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  for example:\\n\\n\"the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nthe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  for example:\\n\\n\"a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nfallacy of division\\n\\nthe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  the first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  for example:\\n\\n\"you are studying at a rich college.  therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nthe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  for example:\\n\\n\"ants can destroy a tree.  therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nthe slippery slope argument\\n\\nthis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nfor example:\\n\"if we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"a is based on b\" fallacies / \"is a type of\" fallacies\\n\\nthese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nexamples:\\n\"isn\\'t history based upon faith?  if so, then isn\\'t the bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"islam is based on faith, christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t islam a\\nform of christianity?\"\\n\\n\"cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\naffirmation of the consequent\\n\\nthis fallacy is an argument of the form \"a implies b, b is true, therefore a\\nis true\".  to understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\ndenial of the antecedent\\n\\nthis fallacy is an argument of the form \"a implies b, a is false, therefore b\\nis false\".  again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nnote that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"a implies b, a is false, therefore b is false\", where a does not in\\nfact imply b at all.  here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about b.\\n\\nconverting a conditional\\n\\nthis fallacy is an argument of the form \"if a then b, therefore if b then a\".\\n\\nargumentum ad antiquitam\\n\\nthis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nargumentum ad novitam\\n\\nthis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nargumentum ad crumenam\\n\\nthe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nargumentum ad lazarum\\n\\nthe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  this fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nargumentum ad nauseam\\n\\nthis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  an \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nbifurcation\\n\\nalso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nplurium interrogationum / many questions\\n\\nthis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nnon sequitur\\n\\na non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nred herring\\n\\nthis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nreification / hypostatization\\n\\nreification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nshifting the burden of proof\\n\\nthe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  the source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nstraw man\\n\\nthe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  it is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nthe extended analogy\\n\\nthe fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nthis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n martin luther king.\"\\n\\n\"are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for black liberation?  how dare you!\"\\n\\ntu quoque\\n\\nthis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  it occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  for instance:\\n\\n\"you\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"so?  you\\'ve been abusive too.\"',\n",

'poly's audience is mostly made of greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to turkish news. however, in today's \\ninformed world greek propagandists can only fool themselves. for \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the tv news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the american newspapers of july and august 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nthere are in turkiye the greek hospital, the greek girls' lycee \\nalumni association, the principo islands greek benevolent society, \\nthe greek medical foundation, the principo greek orphanage foundation, \\nthe yovakimion greek girls' lycee foundation, and the fener greek \\nmen's lycee foundation.  \\n\\nas for greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. the greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the turkish teachers' association, \\nthe komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti \\nturkish association on grounds that there are no turks\\nin western thrace. such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. but they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. this is also the \\nfinal verdict (november 4, 1987) of the greek high court.\\n\\nin the city of komotini, a former greek parliamentarian of turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof turkish descent. this duly-elected ethnic turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of turkiye. \\n\\nthe agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term 'turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'muslims.' the fact that the greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-turkish muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger \\nturkish minority. the 'pomaks' are also a muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (bulgarians, turks, and greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? poor 'poly.'\\n\\nit also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece \\nand the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nthe greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish\\nminority. they pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe macedonians of greece. talk about oppression. in addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' greek parliament passed law no. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. they have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. talk about fascism. the greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the turkish minority, as state official. although\\nthe orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in\\ngreece, the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. talk about democracy.\\n\\nthe government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic \\nconvention in komotini. such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the lausanne convention as well as the 'so-called' \\ngreek constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nthe government of greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nhellenizing the region.\\n\\nand you pondered. sidiropoulos, the president of the macedonian human \\nrights committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the macedonian minority. a forestry official by occupation, \\nsidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nkefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native florina. \\nhis employer, the florina city council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. the greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in copenhagen. he returned to florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nhelsinki watch, a well-known human rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the turkish minority in greece. in august 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'destroying ethnic identity: turks of greece.'\\n\\nthe report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the \\nturkish minority by the greek authorities. it says for instance, \\nthe greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in \\nkomotini. such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe muslim turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nlausanne convention. \\n\\nthe turkish cemeteries in the village of vafeika and in pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. the cemetery in\\nkarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nshall i go on? why not? the people of turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the greek government. the \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in greece does not \\nstop at the greek frontier. in several following articles \\ni shall dwell on and expose the greek treatment of turks\\nin western thrace and the aegean macedonians.\\n\\nit has been reported that the greek cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in europe. meanwhile, greek \\nand greek cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\ncyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in europe.\\n\\nan acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. but we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. the rugs at the amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nshots were fired on the mosque in the village of aryana.\\n\\nnow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'greek atrocities in the vilayet of smyrna (may to july 1919), inedited\\n  documents and evidence of english and french officers,' published by\\n  the permanent bureau of the turkish congress at lausanne, lausanne,\\n  imprimerie petter, giesser & held, caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1. the train going from denizli to smyrna was stopped at ephesus\\n   and the 90 turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\\n   to descend. and there in the open street, under the eyes of their\\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. amongst\\n   the latter the lieutenant salih effendi, a native of tripoli, and a\\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the hellenic authorities\\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\\n\\n   2. before the battle, the wife of the lawyer enver bey coming from\\n   her garden was maltreated by greek soldiers, she was even stript\\n   of her garments and her servant assie was violated.\\n\\n   3. the two tax gatherers mustapha and ali effendi were killed in the\\n   following manner: their arms were bound behind their backs with wire\\n   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt\\n   end of a gun.\\n\\n   4. during the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by greek soldiers\\n   in the ramazan pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning jewish house\\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. this fact is confirmed on oath\\n   by the retired commandant hussein hussni effendi who saw it.\\n\\n   5. the clock-maker ahmed effendi and his son sadi were arrested and\\n   dragged out of their shop. the son had his eyes put out and was then\\n   killed in the court of the greek church, but ahmed effendi has been\\n   no more heard of.\\n\\n   6. at the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded\\n   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.\\n\\n   the greeks killed also many jews. these are the names of some:\\n\\n  moussa malki, shoemaker          killed\\n  bohor levy, tailor               killed\\n  bohor israel, cobbler            killed\\n  isaac calvo, shoemaker           killed\\n  david aroguete                   killed\\n  moussa lerosse                   killed\\n  gioia katan                      killed\\n  meryem malki                     killed\\n  soultan gharib                   killed\\n  isaac sabah                      wounded\\n  moche fahmi                      wounded\\n  david sabah                      wounded\\n  moise bensignor                  killed\\n  sarah bendi                      killed\\n  jacob jaffe                      wounded\\n  aslan halegna                    wounded....>>\\n\\nserdar argic\",\n",

 the gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  i got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"i\\'m not from the gun lobby -- i\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nat 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  randy price from the tv news was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral simon\\'s rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(earlier, randy had covered the goal rally.)\\n\\nthe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom bard.  one of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind him.  a\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\neveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  most of us signed up\\nto \"support goal\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nfirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  and first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, i guess).  \\n\\ncurrently, massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining massachusetts.  the simon\\'s rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\ntwo of their reps spoke about wayne lo and his \"sks assault rifle.\"\\nthe second one, hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing montana (wayne lo\\'s home state) with missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  carr, from gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates only if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in massachusetts.  since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nsome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"in some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(oooooo!)  \"we have some very, very good gun laws in massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nnext up was boston city councilman albert \"dapper\" o\\'neill.  he was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  he\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  he badmouthed the\\naclu, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nhe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  he said this four times :-(\\n\\ntwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nccw or fid, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  senator barrett of reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"i\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  i haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nbarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the fid card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  the stated\\npurpose is to remove fid cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (yeah, right.)  apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  as usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nthe two co-chairs of the committee were rep. caron and sen. jujuga.\\njujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (he \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  one\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  his heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nit\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nat about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nsomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  so they found a bigger hall upstairs.  one of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\ncaron began by talking about how he got his fid 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nhe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis pd back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  great\\nquote: \"if you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (this was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable fid card.)\\n\\ntestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an fid card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  they used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  a staffer of attorney general\\nharshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  he asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the fid were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the fid.  she gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nthen testimony against the bill was heard.  mike yacino (who looks\\nsomething like einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\natty. karen mcnutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nother pro-gunners got up to testify.  one said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  he noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\none of the junior reps noted that \"this is america\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  senator jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto hell as far as i care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (point and match, senator.)\\n\\nanother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\na third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  senator jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  the speaker then responded, \"i\\'ll make you a deal.  you get\\nme the rope, and i\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nnext came public testimony on the simon\\'s rock bill.  a teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of wayne lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  she said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nfour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  one of the students actually\\nshot by wayne lo was also there.  many of them had t shirts on,\\nsaying, \"as long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  the committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an fid.  \"only residents can get\\nfid\\'s,\" he said.  (how much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nyacino and mcnutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo and all guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  karen also noted that hunters in ct, nh, and vt could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the ma boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  yacino\\nunderscored the fact that lo could have gotten an fid as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an ccw, as he had no criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\none junior rep was upset that it would take ma residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  another\\n(caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an fid because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"fid-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  one pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"everyone\\'s out of step but johnny!\"\\n\\nall the bard college people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  the main bills remaining (and\\ngoal\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  h.4375 and four others: notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  h.1732: require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  h.962: require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  h.1350: allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  h.1731: fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  s.1097: state constitutional amendment for the rkba (supported)\\n\\no  several on police discretion in the issuance of fid cards (opposed)\\n\\no  several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  h.1135: ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nsome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nmike yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\ncaron blew right through h.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nagain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"this would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nthe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  it\\nended at about 6:30.\\n-- ',\n",

       " 'dean velasco quoted a letter from james m stowell, president of\\nmoody bible institute:\\n\\n\\n\\nthere has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on\\nexactly what the criticism of \"arrogance\" is aimed at.\\n\\nthe arrogance being attacked is that we \"think we are the only ones who know\\nwhat the absolutes are\".  in short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nin particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  as a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  that question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nthe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nand that means you do not have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do not have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nlet\\'s take the specific example of biblical inerrancy, and a fictional\\ninerrantist named zeke.  (the following arguments applies to the idea of\\npapal infallibility, too.)\\n\\nzeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  he has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the bible is a source of absolute\\ntruth.\\n\\nhe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nhis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  his\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  his conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.

building 36/7, apartment 9\\n   block 14\\n   sumgait [azerbaijan]\\n\\n\\nduring the first days of the events, the 27th and the 28th [of february], i\\nwas away on a business trip. on the 10th i had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the zhdanov district. that\\'s in azerbaijan, near the\\nnagorno karabagh region.\\n\\nafter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in karabagh, specifically\\nin stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. they said \"uprising\" in\\nazerbaijani, but i don\\'t think it was really an uprising, just a \\ndemonstration. after that the unrest started. several armenians living in the \\nzhdanov district were injured. how were they injured? they were beaten, even \\nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \\nand went from here to karabagh to demonstrate. after that i felt uneasy. there\\nwere some conversations about armenians among the local population: the\\narmenians had done this, the armenians had done that. right there at the site.\\ni was attacked a couple of times by kids. well true, the guys from my crew \\nwouldn\\'t let them come at me with cables and knives. after that i felt really \\nbad. i didn\\'t know where to go. i up and called home. and my children tell me,\\n\"there\\'s unrest everywhere, be careful.\" well i had a project going on. i told\\nthe second secretary of the district party committee what had been going on \\nand said i wanted to take my crew off the site. they wouldn\\'t allow it, they \\nsaid, \"nothing\\'s going to happen to you, we\\'ve entrusted the matter to the \\npolice, we\\'ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nwell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \\nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. this\\nman didn\\'t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \\nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\\n\\ni sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"the situation is\\nvery tense, be careful.\"\\n\\nwe finished the job at the site, and i left for sumgait first thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. when we left the guys warned me, they told me that i\\nshouldn\\'t tell anyone on the way that i was an armenian. i took someone else\\'s\\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of zardali, and hid my own. i hid it \\nand my passport in my socks. we set out for baku. our guys were on the bus, \\nthey sat behind, and i sat up front. in baku they had come to me and said that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. as it turns out \\nthey knew what was happening in sumgait.\\n\\ni arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of sumgait is\\nclosed, there is no way to get there. that the city is closed off and the \\nbuses aren\\'t running. buses normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two\\nminutes. and suddenly--no buses. well, we tried to get there via private\\ndrivers. one man, an azerbaijani, said, \"let\\'s go find some other way to get\\nthere.\" they found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake us to sumgait.\\n\\nhe took us there. but the others had said, \"i wouldn\\'t go if you gave me a\\nthousand rubles.\" \"why?\" \"because they\\'re burning the city and killing the\\narmenians. there isn\\'t an armenian left.\" well i got hold of myself so i could\\nstill stand up. so we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \\nset off for sumgait. on the way the driver says, \"in fact there aren\\'t any\\narmenians left. \\'they burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" well \\ni was silent. the whole way--20-odd miles--i was silent. the driver asks me, \\n\"how old are you, old man?\" he wants to know: if i\\'m being that quiet, not \\nsaying anything, maybe it means i\\'m an armenian. \"how old are you?\" he asks \\nme. i say, \"i\\'m 47.\" \"i\\'m 47 too, but i call you \\'old man\\'.\" i say, \"it \\ndepends on god, each person\\'s life in this world is different.\" i look much\\nolder than my years, that\\'s why he called me old man. well after that he was\\nsilent, too.\\n\\nwe\\'re approaching the city, i look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\\nbefore we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. well, he\\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. i\\'m sitting there with\\nthem, i start waving my hand, too. i realized that this was a sign that meant\\nthere were no armenians with us.\\n\\ni look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\nstreet, you know, and there\\'s no traffic. well probably i was scared. they\\nstopped our car. people were standing on the sidewalks. they have armature \\nshafts, and stones . . . and they stopped us . . .\\n\\nalong the way the driver tells us how they know who\\'s an armenian and who\\'s \\nnot. the armenians usually . . . for example, i\\'m an armenian, but i speak \\ntheir language very well. well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. the \\npronunciations are different. anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they\\'re not \\narmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. another one says, \\n\"there was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"they started \\nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. and they didn\\'t let the\\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn\\'t let them get out of the car.\" i only saw \\nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. well he often drives from\\nbaku to sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nwhen they stop us we all get out of the car. i look and there\\'s a short guy,\\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"we\\'re\\nazerbaijani,\\' they tell him, \\'no armenians here.\" he did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"maybe you\\'re an armenian, old man?\" \\nbut in azerbaijani i say, \"you should be ashamed of yourself!\" and . . . he \\nleft. turned and left. that was all that happened. what was i to do? i had \\nto . . . the city was on fire, but i had to steal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nthey stopped us at the entrance to mir street, that\\'s where the kavkaz store \\nand three large, 12-story buildings are. that\\'s the beginning of down-town. i \\nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. i \\ncouldn\\'t figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets. later i was told it \\nwas a zhiguli. and the people in there were completely incinerated. nothing \\nremained of them, not even any traces. that driver had told me about it, and i\\nsaw the car myself. the car was there. the skeleton, a metallic carcass. about\\n30 to 40 yards from the kavkaz store.\\n\\ni see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. the hatches are\\nclosed. and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\\ncrowd is. and i hear shots, not automatic fire, it\\'s true, but pistol shots.\\nseveral shots. there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \\nsomeone in the crowd was shooting. apparently they either wanted to kill the \\nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. at that point there was only one \\narmored personnel carrier. and all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \\noff sumgait.\\n\\ni walked on. i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant. i can tell by \\ntheir gait that they\\'re not bandits, they\\'re just people, walking home. i\\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\\nbut i avoided the large groups because i\\'m a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. i tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. well so i walked into microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\\ni can\\'t get into our block, but i walked where there were fewer people, so as \\nto get around. well there i see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. and he\\'s shouting into a megaphone: \"comrades, the armenian-\\nazerbaijani war has begun!\"\\n\\nthe police have megaphones like that. so they\\'re talking and walking around \\nthe second microdistrict. i see that they\\'re coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building. i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \\nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. what they were \\ndoing i can\\'t say, because i couldn\\'t get up close to them, i was afraid. but \\nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\\n\\n   april 20, 1988\\n   yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _the sumgait tragedy; pogroms

       " '\\nthe existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\\nthere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but i\\ndid not subscribe to that view.  god may choose one individual over\\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\\n\\ni do not, and rudolf steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\\nbefalls one.  this is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\\nlaw in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and the\\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\\nchrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\\nwas completely free of karma.  christ incarnated only once in the\\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  the oriental\\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume jesus\\nchrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\\ntheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. buddhism).\\nmore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\\nresurrection and judgement on the last day.\\n\\nthere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. it is the\\ntenth chapter of john, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\\nclearly here, jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  but note that he does not\\nrefute the disciples\\' question.  in fact, they ask it as a matter of\\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\\nparents.  the fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nchrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nthere is also matthew 11:14, where jesus says straight out about john\\nthe baptist,\\n\\n   \"if you care to accept it, he himself is elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nthis also emphasizes that the gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the last day.  even jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"if\\nyou care to accept it\").  so i took care to point out, not that the\\nbible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  i\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nthe phrase is rudolf steiner\\'s (wiederholte erdenleben).  he noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  it did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being lessing\\'s \"the\\neducation of the human race\".\\n\\nto return to your original point, paul\\'s statement about jacob and\\nesau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nand both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of jesus\\nchrist, in my view.',\n",

*they are judging that the benefit they will \\n\\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\\n\\tthat will come to civilians.*\\n\\nthis is a comment on the israeli experience and is saying\\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. by putting on uniforms and living apart\\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\\nthe risk to civilians.\\n\\n\\tbut if the guerillas do this aren\\'t *they* putting themselves\\n\\tat greater risk? absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \\n\\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \\n\\tcover for us (civilians)? that makes sense from their point of \\n\\tview, but when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \\n\\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\\n\\n\\ni agree with you here. i have always thought that israel\\'s bombing\\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane and\\nineffective. but, there is no reason that israel should passive wait \\nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \\n\\nas i said previously, israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\\nthe attackers had entered israeli territory. it didn\\'t work very well.\\nthe \"host\" arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \\nfrom its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks\\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \\non the civilians caught in their path.  \\n\\nthis is just another \"selectively applied\" statement.\\n \\nthe reason for this drawn-out impasse between ababs/palestinians and israelis\\nis that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other. by your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nthat is precisely why the palestinians (in their recent pisga proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. they do\\nnot trust that israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\\npalestinians to reach full autonomy. \\n\\ndo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians? \\nif you do, then why should israel\\'s view of arabs/palestinians \\nbe any different? why should they trust the arab/palestinians\\' words?\\nsince they don\\'t, they are very reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \\n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". for this reason,\\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have \\nthat the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\\n\\nabsolutely, so are the arabs/palestinians asking first for the\\nisraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? no, what is being\\ndemanded first is land. when the issue is land, and one party\\nfinally gets hold of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\\nis totally irrelevent. if i now have possession of this land,\\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether israel chooses to\\nkeeps its word does not get the land back.\\n\\n\\nwhile the \"major armaments\" (those allowing people to wage \"civil wars\")\\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\\nremain to some extent. rocket attacks still continue, and \"commando\"\\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\\nfor human life (yours of that of others). such attacks also continue.\\n\\n\\nbat guano. the situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\\nwere commonplace.\\n\\n\\nthere is no way these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" unless the state\\nis as authoritarian is syria\\'s. the only other way is for lebanon to take\\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel, essentially\\nmirroring israel\\'s border secirity on its side. it has to prove to isreal that\\nit is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory.\\n\\nthat\\'s what i said, ok? but, doesn\\'t that mean that syria has to \"take over\"\\nlebanon? i don\\'t think israel or lebanon would like that.\\nwhat both \"sides\" need is to receive something \"tangible\". the arabs/\\npalestinians are looking for \"land\" and demanding that they receive it\\nprior to giving anything to israel. israel has two problems: 1) if it\\ngives up real *land* it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\\nsituation (and that change doesn\\'t help israel\\'s position), and 2) when\\nit gives up this land it needs to receive something in return to\\ncompensate for the increased risks',\n",

likewise post-ascension.  i think\\nrather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him.  it was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in gethsemane (since i believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\ncomments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\njason albert\\n\\n[there may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  the\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\njesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  i completely agree that\\njesus was subject to temptation.  i simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  i believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\ni again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism.  i\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was\\nnot nestorian.  i have to confess that the first time i read some of\\nthe correspondence between nestorius and his opponents, i thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nhowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nchalcedon was an advance, and that nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"the christological controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  as\\nregular usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  furthermore, he did say some things that i\\nthink are problematical.  he responds to a rather mild letter from\\ncyril with a flame worthy of usenet.  in it he says \"to attribute also\\nto [the logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\ngreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and\\napollinaris and the others.  those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nlogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  these things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nit\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  but the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  but there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nyou say \"i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  i don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.  it\\'s the divine logos that is eternal.',\n",

(see \"postscript language\", by adobe systems\\nincorporated, isbn # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nso, given a line l and a polygon p, we can write a postscript program that\\ndraws the line l and the polygon p, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  by\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  a quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nthere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the\\n\\treduced problem q.  so, we will be forced to invoke the axiom of\\n\\tchoice (or equivalently, zorn\\'s lemma).  but the use of the axiom of\\n\\tchoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) more importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tpostscript program q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tnow, postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tturing machine might do; thus the halting problem (for postscript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  it is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\ni won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\na couple of references might be:\\n\\n1. principia mathematica.  newton, i.  cambridge university press, cambridge,\\n   england.

(note that the atf could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  why did they wait until january 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  this is not explained).\\n\\nthe next meeting took place on nov 30, 1989.  fadeley stated that\\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  at this point, weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"i had a guy in\\nspokane tell me you were bad.\"  fadeley managed to convince\\nweaver otherwise.\\n\\nthe _idaho statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with randy weaver.  thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  however, the _statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving vicki\\nweaver (randy weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  there must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nthese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of gerry spence, weaver\\'s\\nattorney.  spence said to a ktvb reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\\n\\nrandy weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife\\'s voice on the tape.\\n\\nu.s. district court judge edward lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nweaver/harris case.  exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nother notes: sunday evening there was a report on ktvb concerning\\nkevin harris.  unnamed agents within the fbi admit that they are\\nsurprised that kevin harris is still alive.  first, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the y-junction.  later, when randy\\nweaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nharris had been struck (not weaver).  finally, there was a report\\nthat the fbi agent who killed vicki weaver believed he was aiming\\nat kevin harris instead.  (this is what was reported).  critics\\nare charging that the fbi was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of samuel weaver and\\ndeputy marshal william degan.  some local people believe that\\nharris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.',\n",

       " 'according to what i have read on biblical idioms, speaking \"in x\\'s\\nname\" is a standard aramaic/hebrew legal idiom for what we today\\nwould call power of attorney.  a person from jesus\\' culture authorized\\nto conduct business \"in john\\'s name\" had full authority over john\\'s\\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\\nwork only for john\\'s benefit and consonant with john\\'s wishes.  it was\\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\\n\"in john\\'s name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\\nand be operating in good faith. (note the overlap here between legal\\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\\n\\nwith this cultural background, praying \"in jesus\\' name\" does not\\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with jesus and for the purposes of his\\nkingdom.  the message of \"praying in jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about god\\'s\\ndelegation of kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  this idea of praying \"in jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the lord\\'s prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nthe act of praying the words \"in jesus\\' name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of god\\'s kingdom.  for that reason, i\\'m not quite ready\\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\\n\\nprayers to god for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\\netc.) don\\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\\nchristian or non-christian, whether b.c. or a.d.

we have reached our goal!  a hewlett packard\\nscanjet iip was purchased this week.\\n\\nthank you to the following individuals whose contributions i just received:\\n\\njohn sorenson\\ncarol

product.  wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems.  \\nit runs under windows 3.1 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett \\npackard scanners.  \\n\\nwhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\ni like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document i would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nonce an image is scanned, you can bring up the pop-up image verification.  the \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nyellow shade, which are words that wordscan plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  i have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  it is usually correct, instead of wrong.  if a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  the only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  i find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nafter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.  also any images that were captured can be stored in a \\nseperate tiff or pcx file format.\\n\\ni was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  i use \\n\\nhicnet medical newsletter

that infectious diseases would \\nsoon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain \\nthe major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in \\nthe united states. since the early 1970s, the u.s. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nescherichia coli o157:h7, hepatitis c virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nlegionnaires disease, lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). the incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (tb), have increased in many areas. furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, tb, and staphylococcal infections (2). emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. the substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the u.s. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     this issue of mmwr introduces a new series, \"emerging infectious \\ndiseases.\" future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. this first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of e. coli o157:h7 in the western united states (4). \\n\\nreferences\\n\\n1. burnet m. natural history of infectious disease. cambridge, england:

=======================================================\\n                   source: mmwr 42(14)   date: apr 16, 1993\\n\\n     from november 15, 1992, through february 28, 1993, more than 500 \\nlaboratory-confirmed infections with e. coli o157:h7 and four associated \\ndeaths occurred in four states -- washington, idaho, california, and nevada. \\nthis report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that \\nidentified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from \\none restaurant chain. washington \\n     on january 13, 1993, a physician reported to the washington department of \\nhealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. during january 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal hus identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain a restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio or=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). on january \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain a restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     as a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during january-\\nfebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or hus were reported to the \\nstate health department. a total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection or postdiarrheal hus \\n(figure 1). of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain a \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain a restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. onsets of illness peaked from january 17 \\nthrough january 20. of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped hus, and three died. the median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). idaho \\n     following the outbreak report from washington, the division of health, \\nidaho department of health and welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection, with illness onset dates from december \\n11, 1992, through february 16, 1993 (figure 2a). four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed hus. during the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain a restaurant. california \\n     in late december, the san diego county department of health services was \\nnotified of a child with e. coli o157:h7 infection who subsequently died. \\nactive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\ne. coli o157:h7 infections or hus from mid-november through mid-january 1993. \\nfour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain a restaurant and \\n\\nhicnet medical newsletter                                              page  5\\nvolume  6, number 10                                           april 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain b restaurant in san diego. after the washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during december 1992 and january \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. a case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal hus, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded e. coli o157:h7, with \\nonset from november 15, 1992, through january 31, 1993. \\n     illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (figure 2b). the \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed hus, and one child died. the median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). a case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain a restaurant in san diego (matched \\nor=13; 95% confidence interval ci=1.7-99). a study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain a restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched or=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nchain b was not statistically associated with illness. nevada \\n     on january 22, after receiving a report of a child with hus who had eaten \\nat a local chain a restaurant, the clark county (las vegas) health district \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. a case was defined as postdiarrheal hus, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the washington strain of e. coli o157:h7, with \\nonset from december 1, 1992, through february 7, 1993. because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol macconkey (smac) medium to screen stools \\nfor e. coli o157:h7, this organism was not identified in any patient. after \\nsmac medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (figure 2c), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed hus. the median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain a restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched or=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). a case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain a (matched or=6.0; 95% ci=0.7-\\n49.8). other investigation findings \\n     during the outbreak, chain a restaurants in washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on november \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nnovember 20, 1992. the outbreak strain of e. coli o157:h7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     a meat traceback by a cdc team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nunited states and one in canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nhicnet medical newsletter                                              page  6\\nvolume  6, number 10                                           april 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. the animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. no one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nreported by: m davis, dvm, c osaki, msph, seattle-king county dept of public \\nhealth; d gordon, ms, mw hinds, md,

during an outbreak of severe bloody \\ndiarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). this pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). preliminary data from a cdc 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e. coli o157:h7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     infection with e. coli o157:h7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nhicnet medical newsletter                                              page  7\\nvolume  6, number 10                                           april 20, 1993\\n\\nsmac medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop hus, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of e. coli o157:h7 in the absence of routine surveillance. despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington \\n(1). clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e. coli o157:h7 using smac agar (5). \\nwhen infections with e. coli o157:h7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     e. coli o157:h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. cdc is collaborating with the u.s. \\ndepartment of agriculture\\'s food safety inspection service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as e. coli o157:h7 entering the meat supply. \\nbecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. the optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. in this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. the food and drug administration (fda) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 f (86.1 c) (fda, personal communication, 1993). \\n     regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by e. coli o157:h7 and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e. \\ncoli o157:h7. \\n\\nreferences\\n\\n1. cdc. preliminary report: foodborne outbreak of escherichia coli o157:h7 \\ninfections from

smokeless tobacco products in the \\nunited states almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1). long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nto monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\ncdc\\'s 1991 national health interview survey-health promotion and disease \\nprevention supplement (nhis-hpdp) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the u.s. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. this \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     the 1991 nhis-hpdp supplement asked \"have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"do you use snuff now?\" similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. ever smokers included current and former smokers. data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. confidence intervals (cis) were calculated by using

including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. for all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. for men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. the prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among american indians/alaskan \\nnatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among american \\nindians/alaskan natives and blacks. among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern united states and in \\nrural areas. although the

was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (table 2). although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     an estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% ci=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% ci=57.7-62.1). among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% ci=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nci=64.2-76.6). among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% ci=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% ci=68.9-78.1). \\n     among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% ci=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% ci=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nci=39.9-47.7) never smoked. in comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nci=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% ci=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% ci=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nreported by: office on smoking and health, national center for chronic disease \\nprevention and health promotion; div of health interview statistics, national \\ncenter for health statistics, cdc. \\n\\neditorial note: the findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. for example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     in this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. in the 1991 nhis-hpdp, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. in a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nhicnet medical

adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     the national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and american indian/alaskan native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nreferences\\n\\n1. office of evaluations and inspections. spit tobacco and youth. washington, \\ndc: us department of health and human services, office of the inspector \\ngeneral,

(and yet it is both!)  to paraphrase\\nsartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  it\\nis only because of god\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \\nyour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \\n\\nah, now it is clear.  ludwig was a desciple of russell. ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. both revolve around tractatus logico-philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and philosophical investigation (\\'53).  many of witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  according to some of the implicit suggestions of witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  however, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  on witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   it is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonwrights\\'s comment that witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  on the surface, witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  at the same time, we are faced with\\nwitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. yes?  the most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject christianity! in his\\ntractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of reality by man. \\nperfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  this is why john\\'s gospel is so dear to most christians.  it is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of god, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  he viewed christ from the ot concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  john looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of christ.  and so must we.  words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  he is truth.  the scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a truth and that it is knowable.  there are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  however, they are only knowable when he reveals them to the\\nindividual.  there is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nchristianity.  paul in rom 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  there is the\\none who does not have the spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nspirit (the spirit of truth) and there is the one who has the spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the truth, but there  is the third.  the one who not\\nonly has the spirit, but that the spirit has him! who can know the deep things\\nof god and reveal them to us other than the spirit.  and it is only the deep\\nthings of god that are absolute and true.\\n   there is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  i disagree with dr nancy\\'s sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"i would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would\\nsay unto me.\"  job 23ff\\n\\n--rex',\n",

but for reasons of national\\n  security almost all information about the nsa is classified.\\n\\n  bamford's book [bamfd] gives a history of the people and operations of\\n  the nsa. the following quote from massey [mas88] highlights the\\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\\n\\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\\n  behind closed doors. without doubt, the number of workers engaged\\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. for only about 10\\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\\n  cryptology. there have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\\n  between these two research communities. open research is common\\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\\n  scholarly journals. but can a government agency, charged with\\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? can\\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?\\n  one might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\\n  force all governments to behave like stimson's `gentlemen', but one\\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\\n  scientific fields. the wonder is not that some conflicts have\\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''\\n\\n* what are the us export regulations?\\n\\n  in a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\\n  export of encryption software. one is the bureau of export\\n  administration (bxa) in the department of commerce, authorized by\\n  the export administration regulations (ear). another is the office\\n  of defense trade controls (dtc) in the state department, authorized\\n  by the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). as a rule\\n  of thumb, bxa (which works with cocom) has less stringent\\n  requirements, but dtc (which takes orders from nsa) wants to see\\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa.\\n\\n  the newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. make sure to\\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\\n  least heard of the itar.\\n\\n* what is tempest?\\n\\n  tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\\n  equipment. it was created in response to the discovery that\\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a crt) at\\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\\n\\n  needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext\\n  is available this way.\\n\\n* what are the beale ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n\\n  (thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for\\n  corrections.)\\n\\n  the story in a pamphlet by j. b. ward (1885) goes: thomas\\n  jefferson beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\\n  of treasure and buried it in bedford county, virginia, leaving\\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\\n  ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called b2;\\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\\n  declaration of independence (doi) as key. b1 and b3 are unsolved;\\n  many documents have been tried as the key to b1.\\n\\n  aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve b1 by various\\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\\n\\n  the beale cypher association\\n  p.o. box 975\\n  beaver falls, pa 15010\\n\\n  you can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles faql by including the\\n  line:\\n\\n  send index\\n\\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\\n  (there are apparently several different versions of the cipher\\n  floating around. the correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\\n  says john king <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\\n\\n  some believe the story is a hoax. kruh [kru88] gives a long list of\\n  problems with the story. gillogly [gil80] decrypted b1 with the doi\\n  and found some unexpected strings, including abfdefghiijklmmnohpp.\\n  hammer (president of the beale cypher association) agrees that this\\n  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an\\n  explanation; gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\\n  string.\\n\\n* what is the american cryptogram association, and how do i get in touch?\\n\\n  the aca is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. its organ ``the cryptogram'' includes\\n  articles and challenge ciphers. among the more than 50 cipher types in\\n  english and other languages are simple substitution, playfair,\\n  vigenere, bifid, bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\\n\\n  dues are $15 for one year (6 issues);

claims at\\nfulfilling earlier jewish prophecy.  the scribe matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of jesus of nazareth.  as you will see, matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various old testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe new testament.  we must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  but, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nimmanuel:\\n\\n       we begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (mt 1.21-22):  \"[mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       joseph, will name him \\'jesus\\' (which means g\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  all this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [isaiah 7.1-16]:  in the days of ahaz (c. 750 bce),\\n       king of judah, rezin of syria and pekah of israel made\\n       war on jerusalem (capitol of judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  when the house of david (i.e. ahaz\\n       and his court in judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   and, the\\n       lord g\\'d said to isaiah, \"go to meet with ahaz...\" \\n       ...and the lord spoke to ahaz (through prophet isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"ask a sign of g\\'d your lord.  it\\n       can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven.\"  but,\\n       ahaz said, \"i won\\'t ask; i will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  then (isaiah) said, \"hear then, o house of\\n       david.  is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"immanuel,\" which means, \"g\\'d is with us.\"   he will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  for, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nmatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nfurther, he the hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  but, this is not a prophecy about the\\nmessiah.  it is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  it is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  in\\nshort, it not about jesus.  matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of mary.  it\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit mary.  mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  jesus, while thought of by\\nlater christians to be g\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, immanuel.  if christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   not too convincing.\\n\\negypt:\\n\\n       after jesus\\'s birth in bethlehem, matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken jesus to moses.  this was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, herod.\\n\\n       [mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       herod.  this was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"out of egypt i have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nwhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [hosea 11.1]  when israel was a child, i loved him. \\n       and, out of egypt i called my son.  the more i called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nmatthew conveniently omits the rest of hosea\\'s oracle.  but, it\\nwas indeed israel that, once called out of egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  this is history.  jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  and, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a jesus that flees and resists g\\'d.   again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nrachel weeps:\\n\\n        while jesus is off vacationing in egypt, matthew says that\\nking herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [mt 2.17-18]   by this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"a voice was heard in ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nthe reference is to a passage in jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of israel into exile by sargon (of assyria) in 722\\nbce.  rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of israel, ephraim,\\nand manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  it is metaphorical, of course, since rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the hebrews were even in the egyptian exile.\\n       it is interesting to note that it was leah, not rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the judeans (the land where jesus and\\nbethlehem were).  if anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is leah.  the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to ephrath, (bethlehem).\"\\n       as for herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  one never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nherod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of herod were carefully recorded.  this might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant moses in egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of jesus.\\nit is not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the jeremiah quote.   the \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the assyrian empire.  g\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  of course, this\\nwould not suit matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  again, the \"prophecy\" matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nthe nazarene:\\n\\n       we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother matthean prophecy.  after leaving egypt, joseph & wife\\ntake the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth, \\n\\n       [mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"he shall be called a nazarene.\"\\n\\nfirst thing we notice is that matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  second, we have to ask who \"he\" is. \\nthere are no messianic prophecies speaking of a nazarene.  worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a nazarene.  still\\nworse, there are no nazarenes mentioned in the old testament at\\nall.  in the book of judges, an angel tells samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  no razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  he will deliver israel\\n       from the hands of the philistines.\"\\n\\nthis is of course not a prophecy of jesus, or the messiah of g\\'d. \\nbut, it is the best that can be found.  obviously, matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nbearing our\\ndiseases:\\n\\n       jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [mt 8.17]   this was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet isaiah, \"he took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nas expected, the verse quoted in isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the christian scheme.  we have,\\n\\n       [is 53.4]  surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nfrom a reading of the surrounding passages in isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof israel, jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  he speaks to the\\nisraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  this image is deeply ingrained in jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by g\\'d.\\n      the verses speak of israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  they do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  notice that the servant in isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual jews).  jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  the\\nverses here in isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  while it is believed\\nthat jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  so, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, jesus reenacted the deeds of israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nsilent messiah:\\n\\n      upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [mt 12.15-21]  this was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"behold my servant whom i have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  i will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the gentiles.  he\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  he will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nthe isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [is 42.1-4]  behold my servant whom i uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  i have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  we will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  he will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  he will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  he will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  and the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nyou see, matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of jesus.  christians could\\nnever think of jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  but, the servant nation of israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  when the gentiles come to embrace\\ng\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of g\\'d.  also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nchristologic, \"the gentiles will hope in his name.\"   while the\\noriginal proclaims the torah law of jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  if one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   so, we see that when matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nthree days and\\nthree nights:\\n\\n      now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god jesus himself.  he speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [mt 12.40]   for as jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the son\\n       of man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nbefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the jews understood days.  as far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  what was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  this is why the jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of saturdays, instead of sundays. \\n(it seems like a real miracle that christians didn\\'t forget that\\nsaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  thus,\\njesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      as the good book tells us, jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, friday afternoon.  he then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  then, jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call sunday (the dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  what this means is that jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm friday night to some time before\\n6am sunday morning.  we could also add a little time before 6pm\\nfriday, since the bible is not specific here.  what this means\\nusing jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  certainly this\\nis a problem for jesus prediction.  there is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   we then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   and no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nhearing &\\nunderstanding:\\n\\n     jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of jesus.  he reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  if the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  matthew says,\\n\\n       [mt 13.14-16]  with them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"you will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nthe original isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  this is in 740 bce, when israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of assyria. \\nisaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from g\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to israel and judah.\\n\\n       [is 6.9-13]  and g\\'d said, \"go, and say to this\\n       people, `hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  then isaiah said, \"how long,\\n       lord?\"  and he said, \"until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the g\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  and\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" the holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nhere we see that it is really g\\'d who causes the people of israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to solomon\\'s (and david\\'s) seed/lineage.  if you read\\nthe rest of isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof g\\'d to use israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (look\\nat isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     we see that matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  more than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand jesus\\'s stories.  and, as we see, isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from g\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   once again, matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     matthew tries again to make jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  this was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"i will open my mouth to them in parables.  i\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nmatthew really botches up here.  he attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the psalms.\\n\\n       [ps 78.2-4]  i will open my mouth in parable.  i will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       we will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nas was pointed out, the verses in the psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  you might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof matthew\\'s gospel even inserted isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\napparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, matthew has altered the old testament scriptures.  as jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  the parables in the psalms are not to be hidden. \\nfurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nthis is in direct opposition to the parables in the psalms.  no\\nwonder matthew had to rewrite them!   and still once again,\\nmatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  but,\\nchristians rarely look at this.  matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nexcuses of\\nlittle faith:\\n\\n       in mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  it is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  but, jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   this seems strange.  why was this\\ndemon special?  it seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  no one parts seas.  the only miracles the\\ncharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nmexico or some faraway place.  major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on sunday morning t.v.\\n\\n       and the gods, including jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  they are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, jehovah too.  but, now they are silent.  all the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\ngod anymore.\\n\\n       we\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on g\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet g\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     yet, even the most pious of men have not seen g\\'d.  you, dear\\nreader, have not seen g\\'d.  not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (i know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  but, searching your\\nheart, you know what i mean.)  all that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing g\\'d.  they say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see g\\'d.  sometimes, they\\nsay, \"see the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing g\\'d.\"   thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning g\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   but, that is not seeing g\\'d as i am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing g\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      what we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by christian & atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  these are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  but, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\njesus rides on\\nan ass:\\n\\n       shortly after accepting the role of the jewish messiah\\nking, jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\njerusalem.  \\n\\n       [mt 21.5]  this took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       tell the daughter of zion, \"behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nof course, the passage quoted from zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nthere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  thus, he has jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  from matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  this could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   we find that in the account written\\nearlier by st. mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\njesus.  this indeed fits the verses of zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  now, excluding many respectable christians i have met, i\\nhave noticed that while christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       then, entering the jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling jesus the messiah.  but,\\njesus replied as we might expect matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [mt 21.16]  haven\\'t you read?  `out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nit is more likely that matthew made this response up since jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things and\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit matthew\\'s track record quite well.  we might ask jesus or\\nmatthew, \"haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [psalms 8.1-2]  o yahweh our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   you, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nthe passages hardly need comment.  there is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to g\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not jesus.  as mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nyhvh said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  the jews agree-- it is king\\ndavid.  but, then jesus counters by quoting psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"the lord said to my lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       i put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\ntaken at face value, jesus is denying the necessity of davidic\\ndescent.  one assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  of\\ncourse, the christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  it\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nbut, there are problems.\\n       in jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  and, it is easy to see why david might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  we need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the jews to times even better than those under david\\'s\\nrule.  of course, the jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nchristians worship.  the problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several jews of jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  one must remember that there were various factions\\namong the jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nwhat is the problem, then?  psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       yhvh\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"sit at my right hand, until i make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion.  rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"you are a priest of the order of melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nthe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  but, in the hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  it is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to g\\'d.  it is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  that this is\\nsupposed to be written by david is not certain.  the title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of david,\" or \"a psalm about\\ndavid.\"  it seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about david\\'s covenant and endorsement from g\\'d.  if the\\npsalm had been written by david, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  the idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom david, was not present in david\\'s age.  we have extensive\\ntales of david\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\ndavid was dead, in times of the exile when g\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for david\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     the description in the psalm fit david very well.  david was\\npromised by g\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  he achieved\\nthe priesthood common to melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   it all fits.\\n      we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alone,\\nthough.  here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  so, we let matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  it is interesting to note,\\nthough, how matthew dresses up the event.  the earlier gospel of\\nmark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nmatthew has the pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant christianity, be the target of jesus\\'s question.  as we\\nmight expect, matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the pharisees.  such power is the pen.\\n\\nmoses & jesus,\\nhad it together\\nall along...:\\n\\n       we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in john\\'s gospel.  the gospel story of john\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of jesus\\'s career as told by even matthew. \\nbut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  the early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby g\\'d.  when constructing the history of abraham, moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people.  while this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king david, the\\nchristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  but, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [john 8.56] (j.c. speaking) your father, abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see my day.  he say it and was glad.\\n\\nit would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham, but,\\nabraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah, or anything christian. \\ni have tried, and failed to find any event in the old testament\\nwhich corresponds to john\\'s little prophecy.  it is par for the\\ncourse to see st. john making up old testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner matthew.  many christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nthe potter\\'s\\nfield:\\n\\n      we are told that jesus was betrayed while in jerusalem by\\none of his followers, judas iscariot.   matthew writes,\\n\\n       [mt 27.5-10]  and throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [judas] departed... but, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"it isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  so they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nthis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of old testament\\nscripture.  first, matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  it is zechariah who utters the verses which\\nmatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [zech. 11.12-13]  ...and they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  then yhvh said to me, \"cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which i\\n       was paid off by them.  so i took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       yhvh.\\n\\nfirst of all, the verses of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of g\\'d.  the deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before g\\'d would send judah and israel into conflict with\\none another.  the word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the king\\njames scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nmatthew\\'s quote fit better.  but, this is a blatant error.  the\\ncorrect translation of the hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  however, given\\nmatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      of course, matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  the thirty pieces of silver match judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  however, the correct translation of zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with judas and the high\\npriests.  the high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  the worthless shepherd of zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  of course, to the average thursday-night bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by matthew would be taken at new\\ntestament face value.  to those, matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nwine, vinegar,\\n& casting lots:\\n\\n      then, jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  and, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"they parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nfirst of all, the vinegar offered to jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that roman soldiers drank regularly.  we find\\nthat right before jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [jn 19.28-30]  jesus... said, \"i thirst.\"  a bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  when he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"it is finished;\"\\n\\nbut, matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the psalms.\\n\\n       [ps 69.20-28]  i looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but i found none.  they gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  let them be blotted out of the\\n       book of the living.\\n\\nof course, the sour wine offered to jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  this does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  the psalm\\nquoted is about david and his political and military enemies.  it\\nis not about the messiah or jesus.  it is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks g\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\njesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [lk 23.34]  jesus said, \"father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nfurther, matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       with the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"what of the casting of lots?\"  this brings up the 22nd\\npsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  it turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  as we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to jesus.  it does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\njesus\\'s clothes.  for a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nthe 22nd psalm:\\n\\n      this psalm is attributed to david, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  it becomes a song of\\npraise to yhvh and of hope.  taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  we\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       verse 1-2:  my god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  oh, my god, i cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\njesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nthis suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus, rather\\nthan king david.  of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to jesus or his execution.  jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  indeed, jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  he certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  but, i am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       all who see me mock at me.  they make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"he committed his cause to yhvh.  so let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nthis seems to fit jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  i can see all my bones... they divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  but you, yhvh, be not far away!  ...deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nit would seem quite convincing, and i\\'m sure the early christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  the words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  the correct hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nin hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  the\\nword in the hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  it is convenience that\\nwould urge a christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   but, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the christian translators have chosen to do.  while the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\njesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to jesus so easily.  verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  this naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king david.  as a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  this doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  but then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\njesus.  but the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of jesus\\'s life and death.  how much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for christian\\ntheology.  it is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the new testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager matthew.  but,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  so far, this has not said good\\nthings for st. matthew.\\n\\nthe reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  john\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [jn 19.34,37]  but one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"the will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nof course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nisrael will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [zc 12.7-10]  and yhvh will give victory to judah...\\n       and on that day, i will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against jerusalem (in judah).  and i will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\njohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nmatthew\\'s attempts.  matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  john\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  it does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nreckoned with\\ntransgressors:\\n\\n       after his arrest, jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe jewish kingship, messiahship.   according to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [mk 15.27]  and with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  and so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"he was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nhere, mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of israel.  the passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  the\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  the\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  this also happens to fit the\\ndescription of jesus.  had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in isaiah.  jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  he was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  this is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  of course in his later recount, st. luke\\ndecides to change some things.  luke tells us,\\n\\n       [lk 23.39-43]  and one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"aren\\'t you the messiah?! save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nthis certainly fits with mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified jesus said, \"save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  but then luke goes on,\\n\\n       but the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"don\\'t you fear g\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  and we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       but, this man has done nothing wrong. and he said,\\n       \"jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       and jesus answered, \"verily i say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nnow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  it stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  we have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  we wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nluke.  of course, luke\\'s recount also disagrees with mark\\'s.  \\nluke has only one criminal revile jesus, not both.  it is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of g\\'d do not have this avenue open.  this is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  in this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nthe end of the\\nworld--\\n       mt. 24:\\n\\n       now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the new testament.  it is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity.  jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       the disciples: tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       jesus: take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"i am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   for,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             they will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...but he who endures to the end will be saved.  this\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             so, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet daniel, ...let those who are in judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the son of man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the son of man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  so also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that he is near, at the very\\n       gate.  truly i say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             but, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the son, but only the father... therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the son of man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nfrom this, it is clear that jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  he tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error. \\nbut, unfortunately, jesus made himself to explicit.  he told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the end,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nit is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  but. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the end of the world. \\nthe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the apostles\\' responses.  it becomes abundantly clear from\\nrev. 22.7, 1 peter 4.7, 1 john 2.18, and rev. 22.20, that jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  the end was very near.\\n\\n       for 2,000 years, christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  for 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that he is coming soon. \\nsurely he must be.  all we must do is wait.  can you imagine how\\ntired he must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       so, shortly after his crucifixion, jesus of nazareth,\\n(joshua-ben-joseph), died.   it is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  then the saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  so the story goes, anyway. \\nas has been seen, there were many things attributed to jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  to them,\\njesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  we have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  but, throughout\\nchurch history, christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  what doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  to question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  things may well continue that way for some time. \\npausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, i suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nchristianity can securely keep hold.',\n",

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\ndeposition of roman aleksandrovich gambarian\\n\\n   born 1954\\n   senior engineer\\n   sumgait automotive transport production association\\n\\n   resident at building 17/33b, apartment 40\\n   microdistrict no. 3\\n   sumgait [azerbaijan]\\n\\n\\nwhat happened in sumgait was a great tragedy, an awful tragedy for us, the \\narmenian people, and for all of mankind. a genocide of armenians took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nand it was a great tragedy for me personally, because i lost my father in\\nthose days. he was still young. born in 1926.\\n\\non that day, february 28, we were at home. of course we had heard that there \\nwas unrest in town, my younger brother aleksandr had told us about it. but we \\ndidn\\'t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\\nwouldn\\'t go into people\\'s apartments. about five o\\'clock we saw a large crowd \\nnear the kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. we were sitting at home \\nwatching television. we go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into mir \\nstreet. this is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhouse is right nearby. that day there was a group of policeman with shields\\nthere. they threw rocks at those policemen. then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. they burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\nstarted shouting for armenians to come out of the building. we switched off \\nthe light. as it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\\nlight. that meant that it was an azerbaijani home. we, of course, didn\\'t know \\nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nsuddenly there\\'s pounding on the door. we go to the door, all four of us:\\nthere were four of us in the apartment. father, mother, my younger brother\\naleksandr, and i. he was born in 1959. my father was a veteran of world war \\nii and had fought in china and in the soviet far east; he was a pilot.\\n\\nwe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axes. we start to talk to them in azerbaijani, \"what\\'s going on? what\\'s \\nhappened?\" they say, \"armenians, get out of here!\" we don\\'t open the door, we \\nsay, \"if we have to leave, we\\'ll leave, we\\'ll leave tomorrow.\" they say, \"no, \\nleave now, get out of here, armenian dogs, get out of here!\" by now they\\'ve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. we hold them off as best\\nwe can, my father and i on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nwe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. they broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. no neighbors, no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. we \\nheld the door. they started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nwhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--sasha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. the axe flew out of his hands. they also had axes, crowbars, \\npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. one of them hit my father \\nin the head. the pressure from the mob was immense. when we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. my brother\\nsasha and i fought back, of course. sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\\nwas the judo champion of sumgait. we had hammers in our hands, and we injured \\nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. but \\nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nthe door fell down at an angle. the mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \\ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. father brought \\nskewers and gave them to sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw father \\nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand his whole face was bloody. we just threw ourselves on them when we saw \\nthat. we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. we came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \\nthere, having closed the door behind them. we started tearing the door off to \\nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. then a man, an imposing man of \\nabout 40, an azerbaijani, came in. when he was coming in, father fell down and\\nmother flew to him, and started to cry out. i jumped out onto the balcony and \\nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. we live on the fourth floor. and no \\none came. i went into the room. it seemed to me that this man was the leader \\nof the group. he was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. and he addressed my mother in azerbaijani: \"what\\'s with you, \\nwoman, why are you shouting? what happened? why are you shouting like that?\"\\nshe says, \"what do you mean, what happened? you killed somebody!\" my father \\nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, armenian \\nand azerbaijani, he played for many years. everyone knew him. mother says, \\n\"the person who you killed played at thousands of azerbaijani weddings, he \\nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" he says, \"you \\ndon\\'t need to shout, stop shouting.\" and when they heard the voice of this \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\nstarted running out. we chased after them, but they ran away. that man left, \\ntoo. as we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, i don\\'t \\nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. we raced to father and started \\nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. we asked the neighbors to \\ncall an ambulance. the ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nsomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. they informed us they were \\nfrom khachmas. they said, \"we heard that a group was here at your place, you \\nhave our condolences.\" they told us not to touch anything and left. father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nso we stayed home. each of us took a hammer and a knife. we sat at home. well,\\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\\'ll defend ourselves. somewhere around \\none o\\'clock in the morning two people came from the sumgait procuracy, \\ninvestigators. they say, \"leave everything just how it is, we\\'re coming back \\nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nthen people came from the republic procuracy too, but no one helped us take \\nfather away. the morning came and the neighbors arrived. we wanted to take \\nfather away somehow. we called the procuracy and the police a couple of times,\\nbut no one came. we called an ambulance, and nobody came. then one of the \\nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \\nhide. we secured the door somehow or other. we left father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor\\'s.\\n\\nthe excesses began again in the morning. the bandits came in several vehicles,\\nzil panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. our building was located right there. a\\ncrowd formed. then they started fighting with the soldiers. then, in buildings\\n19 and 20, that\\'s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \\ninto armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. the armenians \\nweren\\'t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. and again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. they were shouting that there were \\nsome armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"they\\'re up there, still,\\nup there. let\\'s go kill them!\" they broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. we were hiding \\none floor up. something heavy fell. sasha threw himself toward the door \\nshouting that it was probably father, they had thrown father, were defiling \\nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. i heard it, \\nand the sound was kind of hollow, and i said, \"no, that\\'s from some of the \\nfurniture.\" mother and i pounced on sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nthe mob left somewhere around eight o\\'clock. they smashed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. they were also\\narmenians, they had left for another city.\\n\\nthe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"are you \\ncrazy? why are you hiding armenians? don\\'t you now they\\'re checking all the \\napartments? they could kill you and them!\" and to us :\" . . . come on, leave \\nthis apartment!\" we went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\\'. at\\nfirst the man didn\\'t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\\nhe relented. we stayed there until eleven o\\'clock at night. we heard the sound\\nof motors. the neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. we went \\ndownstairs. there was a light on in the room where we left father. in the \\nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \\nthey left only one bulb. the bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \\nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\\nmicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nwith the help of the soldiers we made it to the city party committee and were \\nsaved. our salvation--my mother\\'s, my brother\\'s, and mine,--was purely \\naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \\ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to save mother. we couldn\\'t save father. we inflicted many injuries on \\nthe bandits, some of them serious. but others came to take their places. we \\nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\\nshare. it was a miracle we survived. we were saved by a miracle and the \\ntroops. and if troops hadn\\'t come to sumgait, the slaughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the armenians would have been victims of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nthrough an acquaintance at the city party committee i was able to contact the \\nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \\norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. we went to \\'\\npick up father\\'s corpse. we took it to the morgue. this was about two o\\'clock \\nin the morning, it was already march 1, it was raining very hard and it was \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. when my brother and i carried \\nfather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. there were \\nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. it \\nwas gruesome. i suffered a tremendous shock. there were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\\ntaken to baku. there was a woman\\'s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \\nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\\'s body. it \\nwas something terrible. the morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . the \\nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. it was impossible\\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. there was a \\nman there, too, several men. you couldn\\'t tell anything because their faces \\nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\\n\\nnow two and a half months have passed. every day i recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of sumgait. every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people\\'s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\\n\\ni still want to say that 70 years have passed since soviet power was\\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in sumgait. it will go down in history.\\n\\ni\\'m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\\'t even afraid of the troops. they\\neven fought the soldiers. many soldiers were wounded. the mob threw fuel \\nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. they \\nweren\\'t afraid. they were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroops. i saw the clashes on february 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacross from our building. and that mob was fighting with the soldiers. the \\ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \\nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. they \\nweren\\'t afraid of them. i say they were sure of their impunity. when we were \\nat the neighbors\\' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \\noffice i called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \\narmenian apartments and burning homes. and they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. during those days no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone\\'s aid. no one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\\n\\nas we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \\nstation. rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \\nfighting. so i think all of it was arranged in advance. they even knew in \\nwhich buildings and apartments the armenians lived, on which floors--they had\\nlists, the bandits. you can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\\n\\nthanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\\'s leadership, and to the\\nleadership of the ministry of defense for helping us, thanks to the russian\\npeople, because the majority of the troops were russians, and the troops \\nsuffered losses, too. i want to express this gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all armenians, and in the name of all sumgait\\narmenians. for coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\\n\\nat present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the ussr\\nprocuracy. i want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\\npossible punishment, because if they don\\'t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \\nhappen again. everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\\nout for such deeds.\\n\\nvery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \\ndisturbances. the mobs were huge. at present not all of them have been caught,\\nvery few of them have been, i think, judging by the newspaper reports. there \\nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\\'s how many people took \\npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\\n\\nthey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \\nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\\n\\n   may 18,

       " 'mr decenso, in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judas,\\nrejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases\\nthose scholars opinion on the subject:\\n\\n\\nand \\n\\n\\nactually, if you do further research as to the greek word \"apacgw,\" you will\\nfind that it does denote success.  those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  as i pointed out, i\\nrecently checked several lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" louw and nida\\n\\t\"robinson\\'s greek and english lexicon of the new testament\"\\n\\t\"greek english lexicon of the new testament,\" grimm\\n\\t\"word study concordance,\" tynsdale\\n\\t\"a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other \\n\\t early christian writings,\" bauer-arndt-gingrich\\n\\t\"the new analytical greek lexicon,\" perschbacher\\n\\na couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" a\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down).  one of the best\\nreferences though, \"robinson\\'s greek and english lexicon of the new\\ntestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nthe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" this root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  it can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nin literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  so while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  thus robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" he then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in homers odessy 19:230 to denote context.  he\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the bible was written by\\ngod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nby the way, i note that mr decenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n\\nnote mr decenso, as you say, the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to\\ngreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew (ie\" the the\\nhebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek. \\nit should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  further, we have evidence that the\\nseptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by greeks.  thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  so, what you really need to prove\\nyour point mr decenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  otherwise i would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nnow i would note mr decenso, that everytime i go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, i pretty much find it false.  thus,\\ni think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nby the way, as to mr rose\\'s statement about trees around the potter\\'s field:\\n\\n\\nunless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nnow as to your other argument, ie: that the money judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n\\ntrue, peter (or the author of acts) does not specifically call judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does john specifically call judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  further john 13:29 did not say that judas took\\n\\n    \"some thought that because, judas had the money box, jesus was telling\\n     him \"buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nnote that it is said that judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  i find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nof course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  you see, since judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in john 13:29, because\\nmatthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\npassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  thus the money which bought the \"field of blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  oh dear, i\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nmaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether jesus was crucified on\\nfriday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas.\\n\\nby the way, as to where the prophesy of the potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in matthew), you say:\\n\\n\\ni am reminding you now to discuss it now. it\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and i wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdave
